Dear prof and TA:

normalized fundamental matrix is used to better the outcome.
proj3_part1.m is camera calibration, 
             calculate_projection_matrix.m and
	     compute_camera_center.m is called
proj3_part2.m is fundamental matrix evaluation for nicely matched point pairs,
	     estimate_fundamental_matrix.m is called
proj3_part3.m is local matching based on SIFT and RANSAC
	     estimate_fundamental_matrix is called as origin F_matrix
	     estimate_fundamental_matrix is called as normalized F_matrix
Please add with subfolder, if add to path.
